# WeightPlateApp
An app used to tell the user what weight plates to place either side of a standard olympic weightlifting bar.
The app will also include a reminder alarm that will remind the user to take supplements that need to be taken everyday,
and help to remind them when to eat if they are following a particular meal plan that requires meal timings(5 / 6 times a day)
with appropriate time between each meal.
